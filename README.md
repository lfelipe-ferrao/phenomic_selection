# Phenomic_selection for coffee

This repository contains the codes and data set used to compare phenomic and genomic selection models to predict coffee yield.

The three main files:

- coffee_data.rda: contains the NIR, genomic and phenotypic information
- cof_phenomics.R: contains the R codes used to fit a mixed model using asreml-R in a cross-validation fashion
- env_kernel.R: contains codes to create the kernels.
